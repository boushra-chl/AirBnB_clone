This is the first full web application project we are creating as future SE in Alx Africa. It condists of a web application page where people can book their stay. An application similar to the AirBnB application.

Part 1: The console
This console is a command interpreter that will allow us to manipulate data without a visual interface,like in a shell. It is perfect for us, developpers, for testing and debugging.

How to start it ?
Executing our console will show a prompt (hbnb) .We can then write commands that will be executed by our console.

How to use it ?
This command interpreter will be used, as we said, just like a shell, but limited to a specific use case. In our case we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
-Create a new object(user or place)
-Retrieve an object from a file or database
-Do statistic operations on objects
-Update attributes of an object
-Destroy an object

Examples of use :
